          Personalized, advanced approach that causes children to LOVE learning.
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-5 mb-10">
          Here at All-Star Academy we partner with parents, and any preferred
          providers, to deliver a personalized, exceptional education to their
          child. We recruit the most talented teachers that are able to
          customize learning plans and supersede behavioral or learning
          challenges. <br />
          <br />
          Our mission is to drive a new era of education where parents have
          influence and each student is challenged in a holistic manner to
          create a fully competent, capable, and creative member of society.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          Based in Preston, we are a member of the Washington Federation of
          Independent Schools, Cognia Global Accreditation and Improvement
          Network, and University of Washington's Work-Study program. We provide
          a holistic education, after-school enrichment, and seasonal camps for
          children 4-12 years old.{" "}
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[26px] font-semibold">HOW WE OPERATE</h3>

        <p className="mt-5 mb-10">
          We believe that education at its best should extend whole child
          development. As such, our students are taught how to grow a garden,
          how to care for animals and are taught social and emotional skills. We
          also offer optional spiritual classes of Bible Studies and
          mindfulness+meditation.
          <br />
          <br />
          We use individual cognitive and academic data as well as the
          Montessori Method and project-based learning in order to advance each
          student to their potential. Further, we offer mixed-age classrooms to
          best support social skill development. <br />
          <br />
          Our teachers are dedicated, inspiring, skillful and compassionate
          educators. They have been selected as role models of acceptance,
          unwavering kindness, self-motivation, and good citizenship.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[26px] font-semibold">HOW WE STARTED</h3>
        <p className="mt-5 mb-10">
          Our Director, Brandy Simison, grew up in a small town and experienced
          the benefits of small classroom sizes and a tight-knit community.
          After training as a Certified Psychiatric Rehabilitation Practitioner,
          she saw that public and private school classrooms often hosted 25 kids
          to a single teacher. Children with emotional or behavioral challenges
          and/or exceptionalities often did not get the support or attention
          they needed. Parents were displeased with how they had to fight for
          extra support or felt obligated to have their child undergo
          indoctrination or education they were uncertain was beneficial or in
          line with their family values.
          <br />
          <br />
          All-Star Academy is an entirely different kind of environment. We are
          designed to promote a childâ€™s holistic development with customized
          curriculum. We offer an 1:8 teacher to student ratio to provide plenty
          of individual attention aligned to the student's customized learning
          plans. We offer unique learning experiences in line with interests
          that help build connection and meaning to the natural world. <br />
          <br />
          In 2018, we started All-Star Academy to provide this type of education
          for the community. We are one of the most sought-after private schools
          with a 100% satisfaction rate consistently recorded from the families
          we serve (surveying each semester).{" "}
