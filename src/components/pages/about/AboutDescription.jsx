                <span className='text-center text-2xl font-semibold'>Personalized, advanced approach that causes children to LOVE learning.</span>
                <p className='my-8'>Here at All-Star Academy we partner with parents, and any preferred providers, to deliver a personalized, exceptional education to their child. We recruit the most talented teachers that are able to customize learning plans and supersede behavioral or learning challenges. <br /><br />
                    Our mission is to drive a new era of education where parents have influence and each student is challenged in a holistic manner to create a fully competent, capable, and creative member of society. <br /><br />
                    Based in Preston, we are a member of the Washington Federation of Independent Schools, Cognia Global Accreditation and Improvement Network, and University of Washington's Work-Study program. We provide a holistic education, after-school enrichment, and seasonal camps for children 4-12 years old. </p>

                <span className='text-center text-2xl font-semibold'>HOW WE OPERATE</span>

                <p className='my-8'>We believe that education at its best should extend whole child development. As such, our students are taught how to grow a garden, how to care for animals and are taught social and emotional skills. We also offer optional spiritual classes of Bible Studies and mindfulness+meditation.<br /><br />
                    We use individual cognitive and academic data as well as the Montessori Method and project-based learning in order to advance each student to their potential. Further, we offer mixed-age classrooms to best support social skill development. <br /><br />
                    Our teachers are dedicated, inspiring, skillful and compassionate educators. They have been selected as role models of acceptance, unwavering kindness, self-motivation, and good citizenship.</p>

                <span className='text-center text-2xl font-semibold'>HOW WE STARTED</span>
                <p className='my-8'>Our Director, Brandy Simison, grew up in a small town and experienced the benefits of small classroom sizes and a tight-knit community. After training as a Certified Psychiatric Rehabilitation Practitioner, she saw that public and private school classrooms often hosted 25 kids to a single teacher. Children with emotional or behavioral challenges and/or exceptionalities often did not get the support or attention they needed. Parents were displeased with how they had to fight for extra support or felt obligated to have their child undergo indoctrination or education they were uncertain was beneficial or in line with their family values.<br /><br />
                    All-Star Academy is an entirely different kind of environment. We are designed to promote a childâ€™s holistic development with customized curriculum. We offer an 1:8 teacher to student ratio to provide plenty of individual attention aligned to the student's customized learning plans. We offer unique learning experiences in line with interests that help build connection and meaning to the natural world. <br /><br />
                    In 2018, we started All-Star Academy to provide this type of education for the community. We are one of the most sought-after private schools with a 100% satisfaction rate consistently recorded from the families we serve (surveying each semester). </p>
