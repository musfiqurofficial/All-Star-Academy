              performance of any provision of this Agreement or any right shall
              not be construed as a waiver of any such provision or right.

              enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law or equity while
              preserving its original intent. The invalidity of any part of this
              Agreement shall not render invalid the remainder of this
              Agreement.
